# Example Project
This is an example project demonstrating the [IPA Project Template](https://fmi-faim.github.io/ipa-project-template/). The project structure initialized by this template organizes data and software in a way that supports growth of your research project in size as well as in complexity without sacrificing clarity.

## Reproduce the Results
The current view of the project represents a finalized image processing and analysis project. You can think of it as a published research project. To reproduce the results, you need to clone the repository and follow the [installation instructions](installation.md), [download the data](data.md), and [run the processing steps](tutorial/run_processing_steps.md).
