# Example Project
This is an example project demonstrating the [IPA Project Template](https://fmi-faim.github.io/ipa-project-template/). The project structure initialized by this template organizes data and software in a way that supports growth of your research project in size as well as in complexity without sacrificing clarity.

## Reproduce the Results
The current view of the project represents a finalized image processing and analysis project. You can think of it as a published research project. To reproduce the results, you need to clone the repository and follow the [installation instructions](example-project/installation), [download the data](example-project/data), and [run the processing steps](example-project/how_to/run_processing_steps).

## How to Work with the Project Template
If you are interested in learning how to work with the project template, please follow the [tutorial](example-project/tutorial). Or you can browse the different implementation stages by looking at the branches of this repository:
